# Password Generator

## PURPOSE

Using starter code provided by Github user Xandromus, I was tasked with creating a password generator using Javascript in which the user would be able to enter the length of it from 8 characters to 128, no more no less. After entering the lenghth of the password,
I made a series of yes or no questions to confirm what the password would include like numbers, letter (uppercase or lower), and special characters. Upon entering the criteria, a password will generate.
